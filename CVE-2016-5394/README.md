# [CVE-2016-5394 -- sling] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5394 )  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)

Project uses `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.8` , tests from https://github.com/apache/sling/commit/7d2365a248943071a44d8495655186e4f14ea294   
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. JUnit version replaced by Junit5, not using vintage (issues detecting tests)
2. several additional dependency
3. resource `resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml` added needed in fixture, some additional code added whether file exists. The location is unusal but better than the original location in `src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/config.xml` referenced as file (not resource)

Note that the tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability! There is no later version of sling available in the Maven repository that is compatible with the dependencies, and makes these tests
pass as APIs the tests depends on also change. In particular, tests still fail when replacing the sling dependency by `org.apache.sling:org.apache.sling.xss:1.0.12` which is mentioned
as patched version in the [GHSA](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwf4-88xr-hx2j).
