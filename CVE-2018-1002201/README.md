# [CVE-2018-1002201](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1002201)  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)



Project reproduces CVE-2018-1002201 using tests from its [patch](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-zip/commit/759b72f33bc8f4d69f84f09fcb7f010ad45d6fff)
and affected artifact `org.zeroturnaround:zt-zip:1.12` as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

The unit test `org.zeroturnaround.zip.DirectoryTraversalMaliciousTest.vulnerabilityProof` succeeds if the tests checking
for the vulnerability fail.

A minor improvement was made to ensure that tests do not fail because of a missing test input.
