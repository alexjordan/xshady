# [CVE-2018-11771 -- Commons-Compress] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11771)  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)



Project uses `apache:commons_compress:1.17` , tests from https://github.com/apache/commons-compress/blob/a41ce6892cb0590b2e658704434ac0dbcb6834c8/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipArchiveInputStreamTest.java
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. irrelevant tests in class removed
2. utility methods from superclass inlined 
3. JUnit version replaced by Junit5
4. uses Java 8 (note that compress does not have to be build)

Note that the two tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability! After replacing `apache:commons_compress:1.17` by `apache:commons_compress:1.18`
the respective tests pass.
