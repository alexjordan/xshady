# [CVE-2019-0225 -- jspwiki] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0225 )  from [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j)


Project uses `org.apache.jspwiki:jspwiki-main:2.11.0.M6` , tests from https://github.com/apache/jspwiki/commit/88d89d6523802c044cfcb7930cba40d8eeb21da2#  
as specified in [vul4j](https://github.com/tuhh-softsec/vul4j).

Some minor changes made: 
1. JUnit version replaced by Junit5 with JUnit4 support through vintage
2. additional dependency providing mock APIs added: `net.sourceforge.stripes:stripes:1.7.0-async-beta`

Note that the tests __fail__ indicating the vulnerability! There is no later version of jspwiki available in the Maven repository that makes these tests
pass as APIs the tests depends on also change. In particular, the required class `org.apache.wiki.auth.TestAuthorizer` needs to implement additional methods 
in `org.apache.wiki.auth.authorize.WebAuthorizer` in `org.apache.jspwiki:jspwiki-main:2.11.0.M7`.  

Also, in 2.11.0 , `WikiEngine` expects that *""JSPWiki requires a container which supports at least version 3.1 of Servlet specification"* and 
enforces this by throwing an exception. However, the mock container provided in `net.sourceforge.stripes:stripes:1.7.0-async-beta`
only supports container version `2.*`.
